    intro:
      'In short NEOs are short for Near Earth Objects and if your follow up question is: How near are we talking about? Are they going to hit the Earth? How Big are these objects?? Well you have landed on the right page, if you keep learning about NEOs keep scrolling and if you want to find out what objects would be close by in a specific day click on the Near Earth Objects menu.',
    subheader: 'Who keeps track of Near Earth Objects?',
    details:
      'With a quick google search we get: \n\nThe Minor Planet Center (MPC), sanctioned by the International Astronomical Union, and the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), are the primary organizations responsible for tracking Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). CNEOS computes high-precision orbits and analyzes potential future positions of NEOs, while the MPC serves as a public database for NEO orbit data submitted by observers worldwide. \n\nElaboration: Minor Planet Center (MPC):The MPC, hosted by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, serves as a central global database for NEOs. It receives and processes data from observers around the world, calculates orbits, and announces new NEO discoveries. \n\nCenter for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS): \n\nCNEOS, located at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, focuses on computing high-precision orbits for NEOs and analyzing their future paths. They also use the Sentry system to continuously assess the risk of impact from potentially hazardous asteroids. \n\nOther Organizations: While the MPC and CNEOS are the main players, other institutions like the Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre (NEOCC) at ESA also contribute to NEO tracking and research. \n\nData Sharing: The MPC shares its data with organizations like CNEOS and other international bodies involved in planetary defense. This collaborative effort ensures a comprehensive understanding of NEOs and their potential impact risks. ',
